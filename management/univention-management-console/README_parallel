First enable parallel UMC support by defining the number of parallel processes ("0" or "1" ==> only one process):
`ucr set umc/parallel=5`

Start UMC in parallel:
`systemctl restart umc_parallel.target`

Restart apache2:
`systemctl restart apache2`


Check status of all services in target:
`systemctl list-dependencies umc_parallel.target`

To go back to one UMC process, just use:
`ucr unset umc/parallel`
`systemctl stop umc_parallel.target`
`systemctl restart apache2`


TODOs
- Documentation
- Cleanup univention-management-console-web-server-parallel-wrapper
- TBD: Use predictable unix socket for umc-server <-> umc-web-server connection to avoid needing to set "--umc-port"
- TBD: Move port logic into UMC processes (e.g. "--processindex %i" → start-port + %i for UMC-web-server and unix socket name for UMC-server → no additional wrapper required)
- TBD: Split into two targets for umc-server and umc-web-server?
- TBD: Even in parallel mode, keep one process each on old port/pidfile/socket/... to maintain some sort of backward compatibility.
- TBD: Merge behaviour from parallel UMC and single UMC
- TBD: Merge into UCS mainline
- TBD: remove "Environment=UMC_PORTS=%i" from univention-management-console-web-server@.service?
