fix: 
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The gidNumber attribute on groups
   is now synced from UCS to Samba4. The attribute is only set
   if an UCS object is modified. If all objects shall be resynced,
   the tool
   `/usr/share/univention-s4-connector/resync_object_from_ucs.py --filter`
   can be used with an LDAP-filter to resync multiple objects at once.
 * The gidNumber attribute on users will be synchronized
   from UCS to Samba4 not from Samba4 to UCS.
