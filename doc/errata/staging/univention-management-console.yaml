desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * A memory optimization for SAML based sessions has been done in the
   UMC web server.
 * The UMC web server now sets the HTTP reason phrase for 503 Service
   Unavailable errors.
 * The interval for polling of session infos has been changed from every
   30 seconds to the time the session will end to reduce network workload.
 * The UMC-Server now runs with a additional UNIX socket. The communication
   between UMC-Web-Server and UMC-Server therefore does not need to be TLS
   encrypted anymore so that the performance is improved.
