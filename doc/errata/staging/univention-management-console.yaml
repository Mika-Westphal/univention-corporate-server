 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The performance during login at UMC has been improoved by using the
   C implementation of ElementTree for parsing module and category definitions.
 * The regular interval for the processing of recurring tasks in the
   UMC-Server and UMC-Web-Server can now be configured via UCR.
 * Objects stored in sessions now define Python `__slots__`, to minimize the
   used memory.
 * A log message has been removed which logged every session ID when cleaning
   up one session.
