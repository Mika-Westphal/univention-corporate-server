desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Access restriction bypass (CVE-2017-1000433)
 * PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2
   before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature
   vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1
   backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does
   not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default
   CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to verify the
   signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type
   of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured
   explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification
   process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.
