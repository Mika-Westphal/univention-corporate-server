 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The evaluation whether or not a portal entry is visible now got a shortcut
   if the user is not logged in. This can improve the performance in certain
   situations considerably.
 * The groups that are considered as Admins can be configured via the new UCR
   variable portal/admin_groups. Only users of these groups do one additional
   check whether the edit mode is available. This should improve performance
   if many non-admin users log in.
 * The portal does not download the personalized meta.json, which would
   involve UMC. The portal does not need the additional information and may
   save one expensive request.
