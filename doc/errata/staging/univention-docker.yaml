desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The new UCR variable `docker/daemon/default/opts/registry-mirrors` can be
   used to define custom registry mirrors for the docker daemon. It is also
   possible now to configure arbitrary JSON encoded data, which gets mixed
   into the Docker daemon configuration file `/etc/docker/daemon.json` via
   the UCR variable `docker/daemon/default/json`.
