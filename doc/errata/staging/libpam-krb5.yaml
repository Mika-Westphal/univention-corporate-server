desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The behaviour of the pam krb5 module has been changed.
   From now on the module no longer tries to obtain a new
   ticket after a password change (as this is error prone
   due to timing issues in the password synchronization)
   The old behaviour can be restored by setting the UCR
   variable `pam/krb5/ticket_after_pwchange=true`
   (sets the `ticket_after_pwchange` flag in the pam
   configuration).
bug: [52188]
