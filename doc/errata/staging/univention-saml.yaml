 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The password change dialog was incorrectly shown even if an
   incorrect password was entered and the password was expired.
   This has been fixed.
 * Fix listener to set correct permissions for
   /etc/simplesamlphp/serviceprovider_enabled_groups.json
   This fixes a bug where SAML permissions applied to groups
   could not be evaluated.
 * The file /var/lib/simplesamlphp/secrets.inc.php which contains the
   simplesamlphp adminstration password could be read by any local user.
