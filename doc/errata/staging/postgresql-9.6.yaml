scope: ucs_4.4-0-errata4.4-7
src: postgresql-9.6
fix: 9.6.20-0+deb9u1
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * This is an import of the latest debian package. The security issues
   have been fixed previously with UCS 4.4 errata 817.

 * Fixes timetz regression test failures. (Closes: #974063)

 * Block DECLARE CURSOR ... WITH HOLD and firing of deferred triggers
   within index expressions and materialized view queries (Noah Misch)
 
   This is essentially a leak in the security restricted operation sandbox
   mechanism.  An attacker having permission to create non-temporary SQL
   objects could parlay this leak to execute arbitrary SQL code as a
   superuser.
 
   The PostgreSQL Project thanks Etienne Stalmans for reporting this
   problem. (CVE-2020-25695)

 * Fix usage of complex connection-string parameters in pg_dump,
   pg_restore, clusterdb, reindexdb, and vacuumdb (Tom Lane)
 
   The -d parameter of pg_dump and pg_restore, or the --maintenance-db
   parameter of the other programs mentioned, can be a connection string
   containing multiple connection parameters rather than just a database
   name.  In cases where these programs need to initiate additional
   connections, such as parallel processing or processing of multiple
   databases, the connection string was forgotten and just the basic
   connection parameters (database name, host, port, and username) were
   used for the additional connections.  This could lead to connection
   failures if the connection string included any other essential
   information, such as non-default SSL or GSS parameters. Worse, the
   connection might succeed but not be encrypted as intended, or be
   vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that the intended connection
   parameters would have prevented. (CVE-2020-25694)

 * When psql's \connect command re-uses connection parameters, ensure that
   all non-overridden parameters from a previous connection string are
   re-used (Tom Lane)
 
   This avoids cases where reconnection might fail due to omission of
   relevant parameters, such as non-default SSL or GSS options. Worse, the
   reconnection might succeed but not be encrypted as intended, or be
   vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that the intended connection
   parameters would have prevented. This is largely the same problem as
   just cited for pg_dump et al, although psql's behavior is more complex
   since the user may intentionally override some connection parameters.
   (CVE-2020-25694)

 * Prevent psql's \gset command from modifying specially-treated variables
   (Noah Misch)
 
   \gset without a prefix would overwrite whatever variables the server
   told it to.  Thus, a compromised server could set specially-treated
   variables such as PROMPT1, giving the ability to execute arbitrary shell
   code in the user's session.
 
   The PostgreSQL Project thanks Nick Cleaton for reporting this problem.
