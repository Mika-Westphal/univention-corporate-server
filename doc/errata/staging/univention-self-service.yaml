desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The Self-Service module "Your Profile" can now be used while logged in
   (e.g via SAML) without re-entering credentials. The behavior will only be
   activated on new installations with UCS 4.4-7 and can be enabled manually
   by setting the UCR variable "umc/self-service/allow-authenticated-use" to
   true.
   When enabling the behavior all UCR variables for the Self-Service which are
   set on the DC Master must be set identically on the Self-Service System.
