fix: 1:4.4-4.1+deb9u1
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Buffer overflow via newusers tool (CVE-2017-12424)
 * The Debian shadow package before 1:4.5-1 for Shadow incorrectly lists pts/0
   and pts/1 as physical terminals in /etc/securetty. This allows local users
   to login as password-less users even if they are connected by non-physical
   means such as SSH (hence bypassing PAM's nullok_secure configuration). This
   notably affects environments such as virtual machines automatically
   generated with a default blank root password, allowing all local users to
   escalate privileges. (CVE-2017-20002)
