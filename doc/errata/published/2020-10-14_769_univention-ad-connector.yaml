fix: 13.0.0-55A~4.4.0.202010051921
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * If the transport connection is unexpectedly interrupted during a
   password synchronization, the AD connector will now reopen the
   connection and retry the sync.
 * The flag pwdChangeNextLogin was incorrectly unset during the
   sync to UCS if the password was reset without changing the flag
   pwdChangeNextLogin. This behavior has been fixed.
