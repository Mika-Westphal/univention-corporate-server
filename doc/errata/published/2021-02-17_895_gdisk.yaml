 This update addresses the following issues:
 * In LoadPartitionTable of gpt.cc, there is a possible out of bounds write
   due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of
   privilege when inserting a malicious USB device, with no additional
   execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for
   exploitation. (CVE-2020-0256)
 * In ReadLogicalParts of basicmbr.cc, there is a possible out of bounds write
   due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of
