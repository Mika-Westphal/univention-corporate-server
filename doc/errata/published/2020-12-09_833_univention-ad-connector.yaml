desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The connector creates a temporary password before synchronizing
   the users actual password. This temporary password did not conform
   to MS standard password complexity. This led to rejects, due to
   the password being too simple.
 * If a modification is done in AD and the user does not yet exist in UCS, the
   connector should set all values on the UCS object, if they have
   changed or not. Not doing that, led to rejects due to
   missing mandatory values.
