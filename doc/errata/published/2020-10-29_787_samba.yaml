fix: 2:4.10.18-1A~4.4.0.202010271637
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * With Samba 4.10.18 a mitigation for Zerologin is available (CVE-2020-1472).
   "Secure Channel" (`Schannel`) can be deactivated for individual hosts, and 
   must not be deactivated globally. An example `smb.conf` looks like this:
     server schannel = yes
     server require schannel:host1$ = no
     server require schannel:host2$ = no
 * Systems where Windows ACL permissions are more restrictive than native
   filesystem permissions can be made to leak file name information to
   unprivileged accounts (CVE-2020-14318).
 * Due to improper input validation a hand-crafted packet can make
   winbind perform a NULL pointer dereference and thus
   crash (CVE-2020-14323).
 * An authenticated non-admin user can crash the DNS server by adding
   invalid records (CVE-2020-14383)
