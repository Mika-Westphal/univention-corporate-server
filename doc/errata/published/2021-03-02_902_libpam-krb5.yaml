fix: 4.7-4+deb9u1A~4.4.7.202103011446
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The behavior of the pam krb5 module has been changed.
   From now on the module no longer tries to obtain a new
   ticket after a password change (as this is error prone
   due to timing issues in the password synchronization)
   The old behavior can be restored by setting the UCR
   variable `pam/krb5/ticket_after_pwchange=true`
   (sets the `ticket_after_pwchange` flag in the pam
   configuration).
   See https://help.univention.com/t/17403 for more information.
