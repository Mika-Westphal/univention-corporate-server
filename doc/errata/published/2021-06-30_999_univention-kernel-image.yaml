desc: |
 This updates the Linux kernel to version 4.9.272, which addresses (among
 others) the following security issues:
 * Fragmentation cache not cleared on reconnection (CVE-2020-24586)
 * Reassembling fragments encrypted under different keys (CVE-2020-24587)
 * wifi frame payload being parsed incorrectly as an L2 frame (CVE-2020-24588)
 * refcount leak in llcp_sock_bind() (CVE-2020-25670)
 * refcount leak in llcp_sock_connect() (CVE-2020-25671)
 * memory leak in llcp_sock_connect() (CVE-2020-25672)
 * Forwarding EAPOL from unauthenticated wifi client (CVE-2020-26139)
 * reassembling mixed encrypted/plaintext fragments (CVE-2020-26147)
 * Passkey Entry protocol of the Bluetooth Core is vulnerable to an
   impersonation attack (CVE-2020-26558)
 * the get_user_pages implementation when used for a copy-on-write page does
   not properly consider the semantics of read operations and therefore can
   grant unintended write access (CVE-2020-29374)
 * fuse: fuse_do_getattr() calls make_bad_inode() in inappropriate situations
   (CVE-2020-36322)
 * Improper access control in BlueZ may allow information disclosure
   vulnerability. (CVE-2021-0129)
 * out-of-bounds write due to a heap buffer overflow in
   __hidinput_change_resolution_multipliers() of hid-input.c (CVE-2021-0512)
 * integer overflow in ext4_es_cache_extent (CVE-2021-3428)
 * use-after-free in nosy driver in nosy_ioctl() in drivers/firewire/nosy.c
   when a device is added twice (CVE-2021-3483)
 * double free in bluetooth subsystem when the HCI device initialization fails
   (CVE-2021-3564)
 * use-after-free in function hci_sock_bound_ioctl() (CVE-2021-3573)
 * nfc: Null pointer dereference in llcp_sock_getname (CVE-2021-3587)
 * DRM Memory Management Double Free Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
   (CVE-2021-20292)
 * Race condition in sctp_destroy_sock list_del (CVE-2021-23133)
 * use-after-free in nfc sockets (CVE-2021-23134)
 * buffer overflow in rtw_wx_set_scan function in
   drivers/staging/rtl8188eu/os_dep/ioctl_linux.c (CVE-2021-28660)
 * The fix for XSA-365 includes initialization of pointers such that
   subsequent cleanup code wouldn't use uninitialized or stale values. This
   initialization went too far and may under certain conditions also overwrite
   pointers which are in need of cleaning up. The lack of cleanup would result
   in leaking persistent grants. The leak in turn would prevent fully cleaning
   up after a respective guest has died, leaving around zombie domains. All
   Linux versions having the fix for XSA-365 applied are vulnerable. XSA-365
   was classified to affect versions back to at least 3.11. (CVE-2021-28688)
 * fuse: stall on CPU can occur because a retry loop continually finds the
   same bad inode (CVE-2021-28950)
 * race condition in get_old_root function in fs/btrfs/ctree.c because of a
   lack of locking on an extent buffer before a cloning operation
   (CVE-2021-28964)
 * System crash in intel_pmu_drain_pebs_nhm in arch/x86/events/intel/ds.c
   (CVE-2021-28971)
 * Local privilege escalation due to incorrect BPF JIT branch displacement
   computation (CVE-2021-29154)
 * race conditions in usbip_sockfd_store function in
   drivers/usb/usbip/stub_dev.c can lead to DoS (CVE-2021-29265)
 * information disclosure due to uninitialized data structure in qrtr_recvmsg
   function in net/qrtr/qrtr.c (CVE-2021-29647)
 * lack a full memory barrier upon the assignment of a new table value in
   net/netfilter/x_tables.c and include/linux/netfilter/x_tables.h may lead to
   DoS (CVE-2021-29650)
 * memory leak for large arguments in video_usercopy function in
   drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-ioctl.c (CVE-2021-30002)
 * out of bounds array access in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c (CVE-2021-31916)
 * race condition for removal of the HCI controller (CVE-2021-32399)
 * use-after-free in net/bluetooth/hci_event.c when destroying an hci_chan
   (CVE-2021-33034)
 * i40e network adapters stop forwaring unicase packages after receiving
   certain kinds of short packages, which can be abused for denial of service.
