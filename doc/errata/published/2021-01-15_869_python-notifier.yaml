desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The Python Notifier implementation is used (among others) by the Univention
   Management Console server to handle the communication between the main
   server process and the UMC module processes. If any UMC module process
   fails to start within a few seconds the module process is forcefully
   terminated by the server process. Under high load a fallback implementation
   is invoked to terminate all child processes, which sometimes is too eager
   and kills unrelated processes using `python2.7`. This included UCS services
   like
   * UCS Virtual Machine Manager,
   * UMC server,
   * UMC web server,
   * UMC REST API,
   * UCS Portal server and
   * Univention S4 Connector.
   The broken fallback mechanism has been disabled and removed.
